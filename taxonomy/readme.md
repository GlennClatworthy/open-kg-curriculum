## Introduction

OCSKOS.ttl is a taxonomy in progress organizing terms describing the Open KG Curriculum project as well as events and projects developed by members of the [Knowledge Graph Conference](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech). At this point terms are predominantly drawn from events documented in the 2020 and 2021 [KGC Conference repository](https://github.com/GlennClatworthy/KGC-knowledge-graph).
