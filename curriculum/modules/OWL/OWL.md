### Questions

* I'm frightened by the apparent complexity of OWL (the Web Ontology Language). What problems or challenges does it solve?

* OWL enables inferences by drawing on logic. So, many OWL-related references in particular refer to logic. How much logic do I really need to know to design and use ontologies?
