## Content
Taxonomy is the practice and science of categorization or classification [1].

A Taxonomy is a set of terms that have been organized in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchy may arise from subclass relations, such as that appear in RDF, or they may arise from e.g., SKOS via "broaderThan" and "narrowerThan."

The purpose of a taxonomy is for classification.

```
- Animalia

  - Chordata
  |
   - Mammalia
   | 
    - Primates
    |
      - Hominidae
      |
       - Homo
       |
        - Sapiens
```

They can also act as a controlled vocabulary.
