### Definition

### Knowledge Graph vs Other Information Databases
A Knowledge Graph is an alternative form for representing relationships between informational data.  Unlike relational databases, a knowledge graph can provide insight to the deep understanding of the data within the scope of the defined ontology, or rules listed out to define the connections between data and relationships.  A knowledge graph provides detailed information for data integration, unification, linking, and reuse [2].  A knowledge graph differentiates itself from a normal graph by [1]:  
- Supporting heterogeneous data:  knowledge graphs are not restricted by the typing of objects and relationships
- Modeling Real-World information:  knowledge graphs are modeled similar to how a human may comprehend a set of information
- Performing Logical Reasoning:  traversal of vertices between nodes results in  connections from the starting node to the end node and all relationships in between  

Although the focus of a knowledge graph is on relationship within data, the benefits of a knowledge graph include [1]:
- Structured Representation of Data compared to text-based display of information
- Removing Redundancy:  tabular databases require the use of empty columns and rows to represent new facts about the data
- Querying for Complex Information:  tabular databases may incorporate multiple statements to join varying tables together to extract a piece of information whereas a knowledge graph can simplify and improve the efficiency of querying.  

When compared against a traditional tabular database, a knowledge graph provides both  flexibility with data entry, and efficiency in data storage and the computational requirements for queries.

### How Knowledge Graphs are Modeled and Used
Knowledge Graphs are modeled through the use of ontology frameworks such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL).  Both RDF and OWL are standardized frameworks used to represent ontologies on the web, allowing information to be expressed and exchanged across a variety of applications without losing meaning [1].  


### Implementation of a Knowledge Graph
The process in implementing a knowledge graph begins with a collection of data and representative relationships between the different pieces of data.  Defining how the data should be used is critical with formulating the relationships connecting data points.  A formal ontology of the dataset not only provides how the data and relationships can be utilized together to formulate queries to provide explicit and implicit understanding of the information, but also limits the implementation to a specific topic which provides the scope of the knowledge graph’s usage.  

### Example
Google’s extended use of Knowledge Graph provides a resource to create a summarized box of relevant information within a search result.  With a large pool of data sources to logically reason with, users are able to efficiently find relevant information in these panels known as Knowledge Panels.  

### Application

### In Summary
Knowledge Graphs serve the purpose of representing a database with the functionality to query the information,  allowing users to understand deeper meaning found through undefined relationships.  While tabular databases can still serve a purpose for data storage, knowledge graphs provide an efficient method for querying.
