# The KGC Open Knowledge Graph Curriculum
Welcome to KGC's Open Knowledge Graph Curriculum. Don't forget to join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/knowledgegraphconf/shared_invite/zt-q2px0zub-qYQSn3d9YM8uE1mt9Jd7Sg) to get in touch with the community and learn even more! 

***Please note that the curriculum is still under construction and anticipating many changes. Navigate to the Slack workspace to get involved! :)***

## Using the Curriculum
### What *is* the Curriculum?
It is a set of [modules](./curriculum/). These modules are organized by category, audience, and learning paths.

### Then what is a *module*?
A module is a set of learning material about some set of _concepts_. This generally consists of:
* Metadata about the topic, including the audience, prerequistes, categories, and etc.
* A tutorial article about the topic
* Sample exercises and/or projects
* Links to additional learning material, such as KGC workshop videos.

### What is a *concept*?
Concepts are singular topics that when clustered together constitute a module; they are generally tiny and atomic, but their exact formulation may change due to perspective. For example, specific logical formalisms, such as Subclass, would be a _concept_ covered in different modules (e.g., set theory vs. RDF) with different perspectives.

### What are *learning objectives* and *learning paths*?
A _learning objective_ can be formulated as a question that a learner wishes to answer (e.g., "What is a taxonomy?") or as a goal that they wish to achieve (e.g., "I am a practioner and I want to know how to deploy a knowledge graph"). A _learning path_ is the set of modules read in order to answer the question or to achieve that goal. For example, a Practitioner may likely skip fundamental topics relating to defining what a knowledge graph is, and instead they would start with a survey of different triplestores and how they might support the Practitioners usecase.
