# Curriculum Design

## Our Principles
* Scalable: Follow a similar, integrated, and extensible pattern for each module
* Efficient: Follow a well-thought-through design that won't waste anyone’s time
* Minimalist: Keep it simple
* Strategic: Focus on the 20% of the subject that is used 80% of the time
* Not serious: Be friendly, conversational, self-deprecating, and “you” focused
* Coherent: Integrate modules with clear links mapped to associated domains
* Graph-ic: Use knowledge graphs to illustrate how topics relate within a module
* Practical: Help practitioners put theory into practice
* Executable: Equip participants to develop semantic models using executable syntax
* Authoritative: Reference expert sources like those featured in the KGC Book Club

## Terminological Guidelines
* Take a look at the [glossary](../glossary.md) when writing. We want to make sure that we're using the same sort of phrases and terms to consistently talk about concepts across the entire curriculum. 

## Module Design
* Consistent use of running examples (every article should have one)
* Every running example should be sourced from the same dataset (i.e., KGConf Knowledge Graph), where possible
* Every Module should have the metadata block filled out
